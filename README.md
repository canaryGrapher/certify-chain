# Certify Chain 1.0
- Certify chain is a blockchain based certificate generation network where an organization can issue certificates, which can then by verified by any third party.
- The hash of the certificate details are stored onto the blockchain and the verification process is carried out using smart contracts.
- The smart contract is deployed on the Rinkeby Test Network. The contract transactions can be found [here](https://rinkeby.etherscan.io/address/0xd8c6b3C5eec446E7a7E2C4390fD52E00d1099c9F).

# Certify Chain 2.0

# The idea
There is one parent smart contract which can be used to generate a child smart contract for every new organization that joins the network.

# Pages
These are the pages that certify chain web application has: 

## User
Users can create an account using Auth services like Google, Facebook, LinkedIn, etc. The application uses service like Auth0 to achieve this.

### The dashboard
This page shows after the user has logged in. This is the only page that a logged in user can access. There are two tabs on this page. 

- **Certificates** - The users can see all the certificates that have been issued to them on this page. This section would have paginations in case there are a lot of certificates.

- **My organizations** - In order to be issued certificates, the user must be added to an organization. This tab displays all the organizations the user is a part of.

## Admin
The admins can only log in using a verified account accessible through a crypto wallet like WalletConnect or MetaMask.

### Admin Dashboard
An account is created after the master contract generates a child smart contract for the organization in question. Once logged in, the admin is redirected to the admin dashboard with four options. 

- **Manage Members** - Admins can add/remove members from their organization. In order to generate certificates for a user, they should be added to the organization beforehand. In case the user is removed from the orgaization, all the certificates generated by that organization for that user is removed.

- **Generate Certificate** - Admin can generate certificates for the user. This is usually done in a pool, to save cost, so it might take a few hours before the certificate is generated.

-  **Revoke Certificate** - Certificates can be revoked if it was generated by mistake, or the user for whom it was created turns out to be malicious.

-  **Profile** - The admin can change the profile information for their organization which is visible to the public.
